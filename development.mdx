# Development Guide

This guide provides information for developers integrating with the SmarterServices Platform.

## API Authentication

All API requests to the SmarterServices Platform require authentication. We use JWT-based authentication:

```javascript
// Example authentication using fetch
const response = await fetch('https://api.smarterservices.com/v1/auth/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    apiSecret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
  }),
});

const { token } = await response.json();

// Use the token for subsequent API calls
const examResponse = await fetch('https://api.smarterservices.com/v1/exams', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

## Environments

SmarterServices provides multiple environments for development and testing:

| Environment | Base URL                                | Purpose                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Development | https://dev-api.smarterservices.com     | For initial integration and development |
| Staging     | https://staging-api.smarterservices.com | For testing before production           |
| Production  | https://api.smarterservices.com         | Production environment                  |

## Rate Limits

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability:

- **Standard Plan**: 100 requests per minute
- **Professional Plan**: 500 requests per minute
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom limits based on your needs

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

## Webhooks

SmarterServices provides webhooks for real-time event notifications:

1. Register a webhook URL in your SmarterServices dashboard
2. Configure the events you want to receive
3. Implement an endpoint to receive webhook events

Example webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "exam.completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:34:56Z",
  "data": {
    "examId": "exam123",
    "userId": "user456",
    "score": 85,
    "duration": 3600,
    "flags": []
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Our API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request was invalid",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "examId",
        "issue": "required"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## SDKs and Client Libraries

We provide client libraries for popular programming languages:

- JavaScript/Node.js: `@smarterservices/api-client`
- Python: `smarterservices-python`
- Ruby: `smarterservices-ruby`
- PHP: `smarterservices/api-client`
- Java: `com.smarterservices.api`

Each library provides idiomatic access to our API and handles authentication, error handling, and rate limiting for you.
