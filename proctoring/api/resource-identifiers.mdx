# Resource Identifiers

SmarterProctoring uses a consistent system of resource identifiers across its API to uniquely identify various objects within the platform. Understanding these identifiers is essential for effective integration and troubleshooting.

## Overview

Resource identifiers in SmarterProctoring follow specific patterns that indicate both the type of resource and its unique identity. These identifiers are used throughout the API for referencing, retrieving, and manipulating resources.

## Identifier Types

SmarterProctoring uses several types of identifiers:

- **SID (System Identifier)**: Globally unique identifiers generated by SmarterProctoring that begin with a two-letter prefix indicating the resource type
- **API ID**: Custom identifiers provided by integrating systems that must be unique within their scope
- **External ID**: Identifiers from external systems that SmarterProctoring preserves for reference

## Common SID Prefixes

Each SID begins with a two-character prefix that identifies the resource type:

| Prefix | Resource Type | Example | Description |
| ------ | ------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `AC`   | Account       | `AC1ab6cf19509beac1838b2d9c5ef3e847` | Represents an account in the system |
| `AD`   | Deployment    | `AD8471ab6ebeac183cf195098b2d9c5ef3` | Represents a deployment in the system |
| `IN`   | Install       | `IN3c2b1a0z9y8x7w6v5u4t3s2r1q0p9o` | Represents an installation of SmarterProctoring |
| `CU`   | Course        | `CU8b2d9c5ef3e8471ab6cf19509beac183` | Represents a course or class in the system |
| `US`   | User          | `US7a3b2c1d0e9f8g7h6i5j4k3l2m1n0o9` | Represents a user account (student, instructor, etc.) |
| `EN`   | Enrollment    | `EN5f4e3d2c1b0a9z8y7x6w5v4u3t2s1r` | Represents a user's enrollment in a course |
| `EX`   | Exam          | `EXa1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5` | Represents an exam or assessment |
| `EC`   | Exam Configuration   | `ECa17h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5b2c3d4e5f6g` | Represents an exam configuration - this is the core details of how the exam is configured |
| `ES`   | Exam Session   | `ESa17h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5b2c3d4e5f6g` | Represents an exam session - this is the instance of an exam that is being taken |
| `II`   | Integration   | `IIf5a8dc0813f749128504e251fad9e4a3` | Represents an integration configuration |
| `TS`   | Test Service  | `TS6d6011935f4646848ea4f7a29b4f61a5` | Represents a proctoring service type |

## Using Identifiers in API Requests

When making API requests, you'll often need to reference resources using their identifiers. SmarterProctoring provides flexibility in how you can reference resources:

```json
// Reference by SID (most reliable)
"course": {
  "ids": {
    "sid": "CU8b2d9c5ef3e8471ab6cf19509beac183"
  }
}

// Reference by API ID (if you've assigned one)
"user": {
  "ids": {
    "api": "john-doe-123"
  }
}

// Reference by external ID (from your system)
"exam": {
  "ids": {
    "external": "exam-1"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always store SIDs returned from the API for future reference
- When creating new resources, consider providing your own API IDs to simplify tracking
- Use consistent ID formats within your integration
- Include multiple ID types when available to improve matching reliability

## Proctor Location Types

The following tables outline the available proctor location types in the SmarterProctoring system. These are referenced using the `LT` prefix in their SIDs:

| SID | Type | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LT3ddbab9b6a1f40c385e7efc015967034 | Classroom / Lecture Hall | in-person |
| LT1fef2992eda74744a432dc963c9877ed | Coffee Shop | in-person |
| LTe1f2452810d34266864938b4cc8c8f0e | Computer Lab | in-person |
| LT79a424a742534a7689bb5f0803626bc6 | Library | in-person |
| LT5e18eda572134379939dd2ef766ebf43 | Office Building | in-person |
| LT7068df1ade4846abb0e7612c51d7d141 | Testing Center | in-person |
| LT07b8055c8a9c457c82c58b235a05d53b | Online | online |

<Tip>Any remote proctoring will use the Online type and any testing center wil use the Testing Center type. These are the most used types.</Tip>
