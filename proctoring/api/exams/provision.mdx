# Batch Provision Endpoint

The Batch Provision endpoint provides a powerful and efficient way to create multiple proctoring resources in a single API call. This streamlined approach allows Learning Management Systems (LMS) and assessment platforms to provision large volumes of data with SmarterProctoring while minimizing network overhead and simplifying integration workflows.

## Overview

With the Batch Provision endpoint, you can simultaneously provision and manage:

- **Courses**: Create course information including metadata, instructors, and configuration
- **Users**: Provision students, instructors, and administrators with appropriate roles and permissions
- **Exams**: Set up assessment details with specific proctoring requirements and settings

This endpoint is particularly valuable for initial system setup, semester transitions, or any scenario requiring bulk data synchronization between your platform and SmarterProctoring.

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing the Batch Provision endpoint, consider structuring your requests to group related resources together and include all necessary reference identifiers to establish proper relationships between entities.

## Response Features

In addition to confirmation of provisioned resources, the response includes:

- **SSO Links**: Secure Single Sign-On (SSO) links for users that can be used to provide direct access to the SmarterProctoring platform without requiring additional authentication steps
