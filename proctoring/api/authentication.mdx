## API Security
All requests to the SmarterProctoring API must be submitted using SSL.

## JWT Token Authentication
The SmarterProctoring API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Authentication is performed by including a valid JWT token in the `token` header of your requests.

```http
GET /v2/installs/{installSid}/provision HTTP/1.1
Host: api.smarterproctoring.com
token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Obtaining a Token
To obtain a JWT token, you'll need to contact your SmarterProctoring account manager. The token will be provisioned based on your account's permissions and access levels.

### Token Security
- Keep your JWT token secure and do not share it in public repositories or client-side code
- Tokens have an expiration time, after which they will no longer be valid
- If your token is compromised, contact your SmarterProctoring account manager immediately to have it revoked
