## API Security
As outlined in the [introduction](../../assessment), all requests must be submitted using SSL.

The SmarterMeasure API only supports basic HTTP authentication. To obtain credentials you can contact your SmarterMeasure account manager. Once these credentials are obtained you will use your "Access Key" as the username and the "Secret" as the password for your requests.
