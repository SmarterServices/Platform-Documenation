# Webhooks

Webhooks provide a way for the SmarterMeasure system to send real-time notifications to your application when certain events occur. Instead of continuously polling the API for updates, webhooks push data to your application as events happen.

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Registration**: You register a URL endpoint on your server to receive webhook notifications
2. **Event Triggers**: When specific events occur in SmarterMeasure (e.g., assessment completion), our system sends an HTTP POST request to your registered endpoint
3. **Processing**: Your application receives and processes the webhook payload, taking appropriate actions based on the event type

## Available Events

SmarterMeasure can send webhooks for the following events:

| Event Type | Description | Payload Example |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `assessment.started` | Triggered when a user begins an assessment | `{ "event": "assessment.started", "user_id": "US123456", "assessment_id": "AS789012", "timestamp": "2025-07-27T12:00:00Z" }` |
| `assessment.completed` | Triggered when a user completes an assessment | `{ "event": "assessment.completed", "user_id": "US123456", "assessment_id": "AS789012", "timestamp": "2025-07-27T12:30:00Z", "score": 85 }` |
| `user.created` | Triggered when a new user is created | `{ "event": "user.created", "user_id": "US123456", "timestamp": "2025-07-27T11:45:00Z" }` |

## Security

All webhook requests include a signature in the `X-SmarterMeasure-Signature` header. This signature is generated using HMAC-SHA256 with your webhook secret key and the request body as input.

To verify the authenticity of webhook requests:

1. Extract the signature from the `X-SmarterMeasure-Signature` header
2. Generate an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body using your webhook secret
3. Compare the signatures to ensure they match

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhookSignature(requestBody, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const expectedSignature = hmac.update(requestBody).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
```

## Setting Up Webhooks

Currently, webhooks must be configured by contacting our support team at developers@smartermeasure.com. Please provide:

1. The URL endpoint where you want to receive webhook notifications
2. The specific events you want to subscribe to
3. Any filtering criteria (e.g., specific user groups)

## Testing Webhooks

Before implementing webhook handlers in production, you can test webhook delivery using tools like:

- [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) - Creates temporary endpoints to inspect webhook payloads
- [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) - Provides instant webhook URLs for testing
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - Exposes your local development server to the internet for webhook testing

## Best Practices

1. **Respond quickly**: Return a 2xx status code as soon as possible, even before processing the webhook
2. **Process asynchronously**: Handle time-consuming operations outside the request-response cycle
3. **Implement retry logic**: Be prepared to handle duplicate webhook deliveries
4. **Verify signatures**: Always validate the webhook signature to ensure authenticity
5. **Monitor failures**: Set up logging and alerting for webhook processing errors

## Rate Limits and Retry Policy

- Webhooks are subject to a rate limit of 10 requests per second per endpoint
- Failed webhook deliveries are retried with exponential backoff for up to 24 hours
- After 24 hours, failed webhooks are discarded
